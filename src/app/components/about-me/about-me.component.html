            Hello, i`m Vladyslav Bortnik.
            <br>
            <br>
            I seriously delved into programming at Vinnytsia Technical
            College, specializing in computer network organization. There I
            decided to specialize in Front-End development and enrolled in
            course at ItStep called "Frontend Development‚Äù, where I solidified
            my knowledge of HTML and CSS and learned JavaScript as well
            as the Angular framework.
            <br>
            <br>
            Upon completing the courses, I ranked
            first in my group for performance and embarked on an internship
            to reinforce my knowledge with practical skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            I landed my first job in 2019 after completing the internship, and
            after 1.5 years, in 2021, I moved to another company where I
            primarily worked on Angular projects, dealing mostly with Angular
            10+, NgRx, RxJs, Nx, Angular Material, and Angular Bootstrap.
            <br>
            <br>
            After graduating from college, I continued to work on various
            international projects and successfully completed them. Most of
            my work involved creating new modules, services for API
            communication, and bug fixes.
